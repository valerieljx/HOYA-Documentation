While there are many items that can be utilised to store data, the main ones that are used are Lakehouses, SQL databases, semantic model and warehouses.

In this section, these terms will be defined.

## Lakehouse

- A collection of files, folders, and tables that represent a database over a data lake used by Apache Spark engine and SQL engine for big data processing.

- Contains files in various formats (structured and unstructured) organised in folders and subfolders.

### SQL Analytics Endpoint
