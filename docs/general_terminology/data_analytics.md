## Data Analysis

- The process of working with data to derive useful information, which can then be used to make data-informed decisions.

- Generally consists of a six-step process:

    - Ask a question

    - Prepare your raw data

    - Process your data for analysis

    - Analyze your data

    - Share your results

    - Act in accordance with your data

### Four types of data analytics

- Decriptive analytics: what happened?

- Diagnostic analytics: why did it happen?

- Predictive analytics: what is going to happen next?

- Prescriptive analytics: what should we be doing?


## Data Analysts

- Data professionals who gather, clean, study or interpret data to solve business problems.

- They tend to work alongside other data analytics professionals, such as data scientists and engineers.

- Tasks:

    - Creating reports and dahsboards

    - Analyzing patterns and trends

## Attribute

- When working in a spreadsheet or database, an attribute is a common descriptor used to label a column.

To see the standard naming conventions in the Finance dataset, refer to [Naming Convention](../architecture/naming_convention.md).

## Data Architecture

- The plan for an organisation's data management system.

- This can include all touchpoints in the data lifecycle, including how the data is gathered, organized, utilized, and discarded. 

- Data architects design the blueprints thst prganizations use for their data management systems.

## Business Intelligence (BI)

- Data analytics used to empower organizations to make data-driven business decisions.

- BI analysts analyze business data like revenue, sales, or customer data, and offer recommendations based on their analysis.

## Dashboard

- Tool used to monitor and display live data. 

- Dashboards are typically connected to databases and feature visualizations that automatically update to reflect the most current data in the database.

## Data Mining

- Closely examining data to identify patterns and glean insights.

- A central aspect of data analytics; the insights you find during the mining process will inform your business recommendations.

## Data Source

- refers to the origin of a specific set of information. As businesses increasingly generate data year over year, data analysts rely on different data sources to measure business success and offer strategic recommendations.

## Application Programming Interface (API)

- It is a way for two pieces of code (whole applications or components) to interact. The API will tell a user what requests they can make of teh code, how to make them and what they can expect in return.

- Specifically for data, an API may specify how to retrieve data from an application.

## Data Visualization

- The representation of information and data using charts, graphs, maps, and other visual tools. 

- With strong data visualizations, you can foster storytelling, make your data accessible to a wider audience, identify patterns and relationships, and explore your data further.

Refer to [Data Visualization](./data_viz.md) for a list of common data visualizations used.

## Data Wrangling

- The process of converting raw data into a usable form.

- There are four stages to the wrangling procesS: discovery, data transformation, data validation, and publishing.

    - The data transformation stage can be broken down further into tasks like dat astructuring, data normalization or denormalization, data cleaning, and data enrichment.

## Database

- An organised collection of information that can be searched, sorted, and updated.

    - This data is often stored electronically in a computer system called a datavase management system (DBMS).

    - Oftentimes you'll need to use a programming language, such as SQL, to interact with your database.

## Metadata

- Data about data.

-  It describes various characteristics of your data, such as how it was collected, where it’s stored, its file type, or creation date. Metadata can be particularly useful for verification and tracking purposes.

## Qualitative Data

- Data that describes qualities or characteristics.

- It’s generally non-numeric data and can be subjective, for example eye color or emotions.

## Quantitative Data

- Objective data with a specific numeric value.

-  It’s generally something you can count or measure, such as height or speed.

## Relational Database

- A database that contains several tables with related information. Even though data is stored in separate tables, you can access related data across several tables witha  single query.

- For example, a relational database may have one table for inventory and another table for customer orders/ When you look up a specific product in your relational database, you can retrieve both inventory and customer order information at the same time.

## Structured Data

- Formatted data, for example data that is organized into rows and columns.

- Structured data is more readily analyzed than unstructured data because of its tidy formatting.

## Unstructured Data

- Unstructured data is data that is organzed in any apparent way.

- In order to analyze unstructured data, you'll typically need to implement some type of organization.
