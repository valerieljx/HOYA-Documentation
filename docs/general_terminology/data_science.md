# Data Science

## Data Science

- The scientific study of data.

- Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organization’s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.

## Data Scientist

- Ask questions and find ways to answer those questions with data.

- They may work on capturning data, transforming raw data into a usable form, analyzing data, and creating predictive models.

- Skills: Python/R, machine learning, statistics, data visualization

- Tasks:

    - Creating ML models

    - Predictive and prescriptive data

## Algorithm

- A set of instructions or rules to follow in order to complete a specific task.

-  Data analysts may use algorithms to organize or analyze data, while data scientists may use algorithms to make predictions or build models.

## Classification

- A machine learning problem that organizes data into categories.

    - You may use this to create email spam filters, for example.

- Some examples of algorithms commonly used to create classification models are logistic regression, decision trees, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and random forest.

## Deep Learning

- A machine learning technique that layers algorithms and computing units—or neurons—into what is called an artificial neural network (ANN).

- Unlike machine learning, deep learning algorithms can improve incorrect outcomes through repetition without human intervention. These deep neural networks take inspiration from the structure of the human brain.

## Machine Learning

- A subset of AI in which algorithms mimic human learning while processing data.

- With machine learning, algorithms can improve over time, becoming increasingly accurate when making predictions or classifications.

## Regression

- A machine learning problem that uses data to predict future outcomes.

- Some examples of algorithms commonly used to create regression models are linear regression and ridge regression.

## Reinforcement Learning

- A type of machine learning that learns by interacting with its environment and receiving positive reinforcement for correct predictions and negative reinforcement for incorrect predictions.

- This type of machine learning may be used to develop autonomous vehicles. Common algorithms are temporal difference, deep adversarial networks, and Q-learning.

## Supervised Learning

- A type of machine learning that learns from labeled historical input and output data.

- This type of machine learning may be used to predict real estate prices or find disease risk factors.

- Common algorithms used during supervised learning are neural networks, decision trees, linear regression, and support vector machines.

## Unsupervised Learning

- A machine learning type that looks for data patterns.

- Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning doesn’t learn from labeled data.

- This type of machine learning is often used to develop predictive models and to create clusters. 

    - For example, you can use unsupervised learning to group customers based on purchase behavior, and then make product recommendations based on the purchasing patterns of similar customers.

- Hidden Markov models, k-means, hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian mixture models are common algorithms used during unsupervised learning.
