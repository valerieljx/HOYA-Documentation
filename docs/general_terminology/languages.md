# Programming Languages

The programming languages defined below are some of the most commonly utilised languages in this documentation.

## Python

- Python is a high-level, easy-to-read programming language used for building websites, analyzing data, automating tasks, and more.

- It has simple and clear syntax that makes it great for beginners and widely used by professionals.

- Python supports many libraries and frameworks, which makes it powerful for fields like data science, web development, and machine learning.

For official documentation, refer to [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).

### NumPy Package

- NumPy is used for numerical computing with powerful tools for working with arrays and matrices.

- It speeds up math operations using optimized C code behind the scenes.

- Essential for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.

Refer to [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) for more information.

### Pandas Package

- Pandas makes it easy to work with tables and time series data.

- It lets you clean, filter, and analyze data with simple commands.

- Great for Excel-style data manipulation in Python.

For more information, refer to [Pandas Website](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

### Matplotlib Package

- Matplotlib is used for creating charts and plots.

- You can visualize trends in your data with lines, bars, scatterplots, and more.

- Highly customizable and works well with Pandas and NumPy.

For more information, refer to [Matplotlib Website](https://matplotlib.org/).

### Seaborn Package

- Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib for prettier and easier statistical plots.

- It comes with themes and functions for common visualizations like heatmaps and boxplots.

- Great for exploring data relationships visually.

More information available at: [Seaborn Website](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

### Scikit-learn Package

- Scikit-learn is a simple and efficient tool for machine learning.

- It includes ready-to-use models for classification, regression, and clustering.

- Works smoothly with Pandas and NumPy.

Refer to [Scikit-learn Website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for more information.

### Tensorflow Package

- TensorFlow is a deep learning framework developed by Google.

- It lets you build and train complex neural networks.

- Used for applications like image recognition, NLP, and more.

More information available at [Tensorflow Website](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

### Keras Package

- Keras is a user-friendly interface for building deep learning models.

- It runs on top of TensorFlow for quick prototyping.

- Great for beginners starting with neural networks.

For more information, refer to [Keras website](https://keras.io/).

### PyTorch Package

- PyTorch is a flexible deep learning framework developed by Facebook.

- Popular in research and production for dynamic computation graphs.

- Easy to debug and integrates well with Python code.

For more information, refer to; [PyTorch Website](https://pytorch.org/).

### BeautifulSoup Package

- BeautifulSoup helps extract data from HTML and XML files.

- Used in web scraping to pull content from websites.

- Simple to learn and works well with other libraries like requests.

Refer to [BeautifulSoup Website](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.

### Requests

- Requests makes it easy to send HTTP requests in Python.

- Use it to interact with APIs or access web data.

- Simplifies web communication without needing complex setup.

More information available at [Requests Website](https://pypi.org/project/requests/).

### PySpark Package

- PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, a big data processing engine.

- It lets you work with large datasets using SQL-like operations and distributed computing.

- Ideal for data analysis and machine learning on massive data across clusters.

For more information, refer to [PySpark Website](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html).

## Structured Query Language (SQL)

- A domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system.

- It is particularly usedul in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

Refer to [PostgreSQL Website](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql.html) for more information on PostgreSQL language.

### Transact-SQL (T-SQL)

- An extension of the SQL language used primarily within Microsoft SQL Server.

    - It provides all the functionality of SQL but with some added extras.

For more information, refer to [Microsoft: Transact-SQL reference (Database engine)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-reference?view=sql-server-ver16).

## R

- An open source programming language and environment for developing statistical computing and graphics.

- The language of choice for statistical analysis, which is a very important feature in Data Science.

- Râ€™s popularity comes from the fact that most statistical methods developed in research environments lead to the production of ready-to-use freely available R packages.
